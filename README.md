# **Plant Disease Detection System for Sustainable Agriculture**
The Plant Disease Detection System is a deep learning-based AI solution that helps farmers and agricultural experts identify plant diseases instantly using image classification. By leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), this system can accurately diagnose plant diseases and assist in early intervention, reducing crop losses and increasing productivity.

**FEATURES**
- **AI-Powered Detection**: Uses deep learning (CNN) to classify plant diseases.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Upload plant leaf images and get instant disease diagnosis.
- **Real-Time Predictions**: Quick and accurate analysis for multiple plant diseases.
- **High Accuracy Model**: Trained on the PlantVillage Dataset for precision.
- **Web-Based Application**: Built using Streamlit for an interactive and simple UI.
- **Scalability**: Can be extended to support more plant species and diseases.

**TOOLS/TECH. USED**
- **Python** - Programming Language
- **TensorFlow & Keras** - Deep Learning Framework
- **OpenCV** - Image Processing
- **NumPy & Pandas** - Data Manipulation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** - Data Visualization
- **Streamlit** - Web UI for easy image uploads and results display

**PROJECT WORKFLOW**
- **Data Collection** - Uses Dataset with healthy and diseased plant images.
- **Data Preprocessing** - Resizes, normalizes, and augments images for better model accuracy.
- Model Training - Developed a CNN model for disease classification.
